# Brewbe

Ease management of project settings (ports, versions etc..) and build files for different environments automatically.

## Why?

I needed some conventions for different projects to store settings centrally like versions of development packages and export them to different files each one for a single environment like dev, staging or production.

There are tons of tools out there (like zc.buildout and its filetemplate recipe) and you could configure build tools like Gulp and Grunt to do it but it should be more easy in usage without much configuration. Sometimes you dont need the boilerplate ;-)

## Features

* Buildout relevant files for development
* Store configuration settings (like versions, ports) centrally
* Keep configuration overhead low
* Automatically export different files for different environments
* Automatically keep .gitignore up-to-date

## Requirements

* Node TBD

## Installation

    npm install brewbe -g

## Usage

    TBD
